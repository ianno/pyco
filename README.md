PyCo
====
#### a Python library for Contract-based synthesis


This library provides tools to perform synthesis of
*Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)-based Assume/Guarantee (A/G)contracts*.
Given a contract describing the system specification,
PyCo is able to choose other contracts from a library,
and connect them together such that their composition
is a refinement of the specification.

## Prerequisites
To use PyCo, you need to first install [pycolite](https://github.com/ianno/pycolite),
which provides some low level primitives to manipulate contracts.

## Getting Started
This project can be installed as a python package,
and can be used by importing it in your python source files.

### Installing
To install the library, go to the root folder of the project (AFTER having installed [pycolite](https://github.com/ianno/pycolite)) and, from a command line, run

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This last command will install all the required python dependencies.

### Testing
To make sure the installation has been successful,
you can run some tests by running from a command line,
always in the project root folder:

```bash
python -m pytest pyco/tests/test_synthesis.py
```
After executing the last command, you should get a message saying that all the tests were passed.

## Running PyCo
You can integrate PyCo in your projects as a python package.
Check out the examples in `pyco/examples` and `pyco/tests`.

A typical usage example of PyCo can be found in the `design_example.py` file.
The library used in the example is defined in
`pyco/examples/example_eps_facs.py`.

To execute it, run from a command line:

```bash
python design_example.py
```

After synthesis, the tool generates a PDF file with the solution representation, and a text file with extension `.pyco`,
containing the same information in ASCII friendly format.

### FACS 2016
This work has been developed as a supporting tool for a work presented at [Formal Aspects of Component Software - The 13th International Conference, Besan√ßon, France - FACS 2016](http://events.femto-st.fr/facs2016/).

To run the experiments used in the paper, see and run the `pyco_facs.py` file.

For info on how to execute `pyco_facs.py`, use the command:

```bash
python pyco_facs.py --help
```

To take a look a the library used for FACS 2016,
check `pyco/examples/example_eps_facs.py` and
`pyco/tests/test_eps_facs.py`.
All the tests have been written to be run as a py.test test suite.
